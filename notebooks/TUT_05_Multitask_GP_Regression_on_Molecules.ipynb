        "Multitask learning is concerned with using a shared representation to learn several tasks; the idea being that predictive performance on a given task may benefit from the training signals of related tasks. Multioutput Gaussian processes (MOGPs) is the term given to models that perform multitask learning in the Gaussian process framework.\n",

        "Formally, we seek to carry out Bayesian inference over a stochastic function $f: \\mathbb{R}^D \\to \\mathbb{R}^P$ where $P$ is the number of tasks and we have access to observations $\\{(\\mathbf{x_{11}}, y_{11}), \\dotsc , (\\mathbf{x_{1N}}, y_{1N}), \\dotsc , (\\mathbf{x_{P1}}, y_{P1}), \\dotsc , (\\mathbf{x_{PN}}, y_{PN})\\}$. For each input, we may only have labels for a subset of the tasks.\n",

        "To build a MOGP we compute a kernel $k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x'}) \\cdot B[i, j]$ where $B$ is a positive semidefinite $P \\times P$ matrix , where the $(i, j)\\text{th}$ entry of the matrix $B$ multiplies the covariance of the $i$-th function at $\\mathbf{x}$ and the $j$-th function at $\\mathbf{x'}$. $B$ is often referred to as an index kernel because it indexes the tasks.\n",

        "Positive semi-definiteness of $B$ is guaranteed by parametrising the Cholesky decomposition $LL^{\\top}$ where $L$, the Cholesky factor, is a lower triangular matrix and the parameters may be learned alongside the kernel hyperparameters by optimising the marginal likelihood.\n",
