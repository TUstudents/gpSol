        "So far we have only considered the GP as a regressor and have not considered use-cases for the GP's uncertainty estimates. One such use-case is virtual screening applications where one would like to use model uncertainty as a criteria for prioritising molecules for synthesis; the intuition is that if two molecules have the same predicted property under the model, it will be desirable to choose the one where the model has highest confidence or equivalently lowest uncertainty. To assess whether a model's confidence is correlated with prediction error, one may plot a confidence-error curve as illustrated below."

        "The x-axis, `Confidence Percentile`, ranks each test datapoint prediction according to the GP predictive variance. For example, molecules that reside above the 80th confidence percentile will correspond to the 20% of test set molecules with the lowest GP predictive uncertainty. The prediction error at each confidence percentile is then measured over 20 random train/test splits (the standard error over the random splits is plotted in the figure above) to gauge if the model’s confidence is correlated with the prediction error. The figure above shows that the SMILES GP's uncertainty estimates are positively correlated with the prediction error. As such, it is possible that model uncertainty could be used as a component in the decision-making process for prioritising molecules for laboratory synthesis."
